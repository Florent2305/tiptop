.SH NAME
tiptop \- display hardware performance counters for Linux tasks

.SH SYNOPSIS
\*(ME [OPTION]

\*(ME [OPTION] -- command  (EXPERIMENTAL)

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \*(ME program provides a dynamic real-time view of the tasks
running in the system. \*(Me is very similar to top (1), but the
information displayed comes from hardware counters.

\*(Me has two running \fImodes\fR: live-mode and batch-mode. In both
modes, the system is periodically queried for the values of hardware
counters, and various ratios are printed for each task. In live-mode,
the display is regularly updated with new values at constant time
intervals. In batch-mode, the same information is emitted to
stdout. Batch-mode is appropriate for saving to a file or for further
processing. No interaction is possible in batch-mode.

Unless \*(Me is run by root, or the executable is setuid-root, a user
can only monitor the tasks it owns.

The results produced by \*(Me are organized in \fIscreens\fR. A screen
consists in rows representing tasks, and columns reporting various
values and ratios collected from hardware counters. Many screens can
be defined. Only one screen is displayed at a time. The default screen
(number 0) reports target independent values as defined in the file
/usr/include/linux/event_counter.h. Other screens may rely on
target-dependent counters.

If -- appears in the command line, \*(Me treats the rest of the line
as a command. A new process if forked, and hardware counters are
attached just before execvp is called. This makes it possible to trace
an application from the first instruction. This is experimental!

\*(Me requires Linux 2.6.31+.


.SH COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS
Command line options with a parameter override values specified in the
configuration file. Toggles set the value or invert the value read in
the configuration file (if any).

.TP 4
\-\fBb\fR
Start \*(Me in batch-mode. Output is sent to stdout, and no
interactive command is accepted. \*(Me will run forever, or until the
number of iterations specified by \fB-n\fR.

.TP 4
\-\fBc\fR
display the command line of the task instead of its name.

.TP 4
\-\-\fBcpu\-min\fR VALUE
%CPU activity threshold. Below this value, a task is considered
 idle and is not reported (unless idle-mode is on).

.TP 4
\-\fBd\fR VALUE
Specify the delay between refreshes. VALUE can be fractional.

.TP 4
\-\-\fBepoch\fR
Print the Epoch at each refresh. In batch-mode, it is printed at the
beginning of each row. In live-mode, it is at the bottom of the
display.

.TP 4
\-\fBh --help\fR
Print a brief help message and exit.

.TP 4
\-\fBH\fR
Show threads (or toggle the configuration file setting).

.TP 4
\-\fBi\fR
Show idle tasks (or toggle the configuration file setting).

.TP 4
\-\fBK --kernel\fR
Include kernel activity in the reported values. This is only possible
is the user is root, or the \*(Me executable is setuid root.

.TP 4
\-\-\fBlist\-screens\fR
List available screens and exit.

.TP 4
\-\fBn\fR VALUE
Automatically exit after VALUE iterations.

.TP 4
\-\fBo\fR FILENAME
Specify the filename for the output of batch mode.

.TP 4
\-\fBp --pid\fR VALUE
Only display selected tasks. VALUE can be either the numeric value
PID, or a string. In case of a string, all tasks whose names or
command lines (depending on the display, see -c) contain VALUE are
reported.

.TP 4
\-\fBS\fR VALUE
Start \*(Me with screen number VALUE.

.TP 4
\-\-\fBsticky\fR
Start in sticky mode: tasks stay in the list after they die. In
live-mode, they appear in a different color (when supported). In
batch-mode, the word DEAD is appended.

.TP 4
\-\-\fBtimestamp\fR
Print a timestamp at the beginning of each row. The timestamp is the
number of refreshes so far. In batch-mode, it is printed at the
beginning of each row. In live-mode, it is at the bottom of the
display.

.TP 4
\-\fBu\fR USER
Only show tasks owned by USER. USER can be either a login name, or the
numeric value UID.

.TP 4
\-\fBU\fR
Show the owner of each task (or toggle the configuration file setting).

.TP 4
\-\fBv\fR
Display build information and exit.

.TP 4
\-\-\fBversion\fR
Display version information and disclaimer and exit.

.TP 4
\-\fBw\fR VALUE
Watch the task specified by VALUE. VALUE can be either the numeric
value PID, or a string. In case of a string, all tasks whose names or
command lines (depending on the display, see -c) contain VALUE are
reported. In live-mode, watched tasks are shown in a different color
(when supported). In batch-mode, an ASCII arrow points to the watched
tasks.

.TP 4
\-\fBW\fR VALUE
Directory where the configuration file is located.

.SH INTERACTIVE COMMANDS
In live-mode, \*(Me accepts single-key commands.

.TP 4
\fBLEFT\fR, \fBRIGHT\fR
Rotate through available screens.

.TP 4
\fB<\fR, \fB>\fR
Change the reference column for sorting to the left or to the right.

.TP 4
\fBc\fR
Toggle between showing task names and command lines.

.TP 4
\fBd\fR
Change the refresh interval. The new value is queried. Positive,
non-zero fractional values are accepted.

.TP 4
\fBh\fR
Display a brief description of the columns.

.TP 4
\fBH\fR
Toggle between showing individual threads and accumulating values per
process.

.TP 4
\fBi\fR
Toggle between showing only active tasks and showing also idle tasks.

.TP 4
\fBK\fR
Toggle between showing kernel activity and only user activity. Kernel
mode is only available to root.

.TP 4
\fBk\fR
Kill a process. The user is asked for the PID, and the signal to send.

.TP 4
\fBp\fR
Used to display only selected task. The user is asked for a PID or
string. In case a string is entered, only the tasks whose name or command
line contain the string are displayed.

.TP 4
\fBq\fR
Quit.

.TP 4
\fBR\fR
Change sorting order: ascending or descending.

.TP 4
\fBS\fR
Toggle sticky mode.

.TP 4
\fBs\fR
Same as d.

.TP 4
\fBu\fR
Only show tasks owned by a given user. The user name or PID is
queried. Note that, unless \*(Me is run by root or setuid root, tasks
owned by somebody else cannot be monitored.

.TP 4
\fBU\fR
Toggle displaying each task's owner.

.TP 4
\fBw\fR
Used to track a particular task. The user is asked for a PID or
string. In case a string is entered, all tasks whose name or command
line contain the string are highlighted.

.TP 4
\fBW\fR
Writes a configuration file for the current state in the current
directory.


.SH FILES
During startup, \*(ME attemps to read a configuration file. The file
must be named \fB.tiptoprc\fR. This file is first searched in the
current directory, then in the directory defined by the environment
variable \fBTIPTOP\fR if it exists, finally in the user's home.

.SS Syntax
The file is structured in XML. The syntax is as following.

.IP "Root of tree"
The root of the xml tree is tiptop.
<tiptop> ... </tiptop>

.IP "Options"
Options can be specified on an <options> block.

<options>
  <option name="option1" value="value_option1"/>
  <option name="option2" value="value_option2"/>
       ...
</options>

Recognized options listed below, with their corresponding command line
option.

batch (-b), cpu_threshold (--cpu-min), debug (-g), delay (-d), idle
(-i), max_iter (-n), show_cmdline (-c), show_epoch (--epoch),
show_kernel (-K), show_timestamp (--timestamp), show_threads (-H),
show_user (-U), watch_name (-w), sticky (--sticky), watch_uid (-w)

.IP "Screens"
Screens are defined inside a <screen> block. A screen is made of
counters and columns. A screen has a name and an optional description.

<screen name="my_screen" desc="what this screen is about">
...
</screen>

Counters must provide an alias (used for further reference) and a
configuration. The configuration is either a predefined value, or the
actual value that must be provided to the perf_even_open system call
(typically found in vendor architecture manuals).

Predefined values are: CPU_CYCLES, INSTRUCTIONS, CACHE_REFERENCES,
CACHE_MISSES, BRANCH_INSTRUCTIONS, BRANCH_MISSES, and BUS_CYCLES.

.nf
<counter alias="instr" config="INSTRUCTIONS" />
.fi

For non-predefined configs, a type must be provided. Currently, only
RAW and HW_CACHE are supported.

Optionally, a counter may be restricted to a specific architecture
(such as "x86"), and a model. The definition of the model is
architecture-dependent. For x86, it is defined as
DisplayFamily_DisplayModel as computed by the instruction CPUID.  A
counter for issued micro-ops on Sandy Bridge may look like the
following:

.nf
<counter alias="uops_issued" config="0x010e"
         type="RAW" arch="x86" model="06_2a" />
.fi

See also /usr/include/linux/perf_events.h for more on config and type.

A column defines its header, the printf-like format for values, and an
expression. Expressions evaluate as double precision. A description is
optional.

.nf
<counter alias="instr" config="INSTRUCTIONS" />
<counter alias="cycle" config="CPU_CYCLES" />
<view header=" IPC" format="%4.2f"
      desc="Total instructions per cycle"
      expr="instr/cycle"/>
<view header=" ipc" format="%4.2f"
      desc="Total instructions per cycle"
      expr="instr/cycle" />
.fi

The syntax of expressions supports basic arithmetic (+ - * /
parentheses and constants). The special notation "delta(counter)"
evaluates as the variation of the counter between refreshes.
Expressions can also refer to predefined variables such as CPU_TOT
(CPU usage), CPU_SYS (system CPU usage), CPU_USER (user CPU usage),
PROC_ID (processor where the process was last seen).

.nf
<view header=" ipc" format="%4.2f"
      desc="Instantaneaous IPC"
      expr="delta(instr) / delta(cycle)" />
.fi

    <view header="  Mcycle" format="%8.2f"
          desc="Cycles (millions)"
          expr="delta(cycle) / 1000000" />
    <view header="  Minstr" format="%8.2f"
          desc="Instructions (millions)"
          expr="delta(instr) / 1000000" />
    <view header=" IPC" format="%4.2f"
          desc="Executed instructions per cycle"
          expr="delta(instr) / delta(cycle)" />
    <view header=" %MISS" format="%6.2f"
          desc="Cache miss per instructions (in %)"
          expr="100 * delta(miss) / delta(instr)" />
    <view header=" %BMIS" format="%6.2f"
          desc="Branch misprediction per instruction (in %)"
          expr="100 * delta(br_miss) / delta(instr)" />
    <view header="uops/inst" format="     %4.1f"
          desc="Number of issued uops per instruction"
          expr="delta(uops_issued) / delta(instr)" />
